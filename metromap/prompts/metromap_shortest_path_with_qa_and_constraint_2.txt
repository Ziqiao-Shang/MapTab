# Role
You are a Subway Pathfinding Algorithm. You strictly analyze the provided metro map, two tabulars (an Edge Table and a Vertex Table), and compute the cheapest route.

# Input Task
{question}

# Objective
In the case of considering Price as the only factor, return only one final route — the one you believe is the cheapest overall choice based on edge costs.
A station cannot appear more than once in the route. Cannot reselect the path that has already been taken!

# Input Data Description
The input consists of:
1. One metro map image
2. Two tabulars:
- **Edge Table**: each edge contains a `Price` attribute representing the monetary cost needed to travel from one station to the next
- **Vertex Table**: **not considered** for any factor in this task

# Pathfinding Requirements
1. The metro system must be treated as a weighted graph where each edge receives its Price from the Edge Table.
2. Vertex attributes are ignored.
3. Total cost is computed solely from the edge Price values.
4. All Price values, originally within 0–1.5, must be scaled proportionally into 0–1 before computing the final score.

# Route Output Format Constraints
- **Separator**: Use hyphens `-` strictly, with no spaces around the hyphens.
- **Transfer Marking**: If a line transfer occurs at a station, append `(transfer)` immediately after its name.
- **Content**: Output only the final route string. No markdown, no explanation, no filler.
- **Route Format**: The route must be in the strict format `<route_begin><route_end>`, where `<route_begin>` and `<route_end>` are the start and end of the path respectively.

# Additional Output: Total Time, Total Price, Average Comfort Level, and Average Reliability
In addition to the route, we also need to output the following four metrics: Total Time, Total Price, Average Comfort Level, and Average Reliability. These four metrics will also serve as reference points for the user.
1. **The four metrics — Total Time, Total Price, Average Comfort Level, and Average Reliability — must be calculated using raw (un-normalized) data**:  
   - `Time`: actual values between 0–3
   - `Transfer Time`: actual values between 5–15
   - `Price`: actual values between 0–1.5
   - `Comfort Level` and `Reliability`: direct values between 0–1
2. **Total Time**: sum of the Time values from all edges and stations along the route, where the starting station’s Time is fully included and the destination station’s Time is excluded; a station’s Transfer Time is added only when a line transfer occurs at that station, otherwise its transfer time is treated as 0. The Time values are used directly in their original scale (0–3) without normalization or weighting, and the Transfer Time values are also used directly in their original scale (5–15) without normalization or weighting.
3. **Total Price**: sum of all `Price` values from edges along the route. Values are used directly (0–1.5) without normalization or weighting.
4. **Average Comfort Level**: mean of the `Comfort Level` values of all edges and stations along the route. The destination station is excluded; the starting station is included. Values are used directly (0–1) without normalization or weighting.
5. **Average Reliability**: mean of the `Reliability` values of all stations along the route. The destination station is excluded; the starting station is included. Values are used directly (0–1) without normalization or weighting.
6. **Summary Rules**:  
   - All four metrics are computed from raw data only.  
   - The destination station is excluded from all calculations.   
   - These metrics are **for reference** and are **not** used in the path selection.

# Total Time, Total Price, Average Comfort Level, and Average Reliability Respectively Output Example Format:
1. **Route**: `<route_begin>Station1-Station2(transfer)-Station3-Station4<route_end>`
2. **Total Time**: `<Total_Time_begin>xx.xx<Total_Time_end>`
3. **Total Price**: `<Total_Price_begin>xx.xx<Total_Price_end>`
4. **Average Comfort Level**: `<Average_Comfort Level_begin>xx.xxxxxx<Average_Comfort Level_end>`
5. **Average Reliability**: `<Average_Reliability_begin>xx.xxxxxx<Average_Reliability_end>`

# Few-Shot Output Examples
Notice that this is only the output format example. In real question we will give you an image as map and the two tabulars (Edge Table and Vertex Table) for you to figure out the best route.
