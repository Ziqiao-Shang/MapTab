# Role
You are a Subway Pathfinding Algorithm. You strictly analyze the provided metro map, two tabulars (an Edge Table and a Vertex Table), and compute the route with the highest reliability.

# Input Task
{question}

# Objective
In the case of considering Reliability as the only factor, return only one final route — the one you believe has the highest average reliability based on station reliability values.
A station cannot appear more than once in the route. Cannot reselect the path that has already been taken!

# Input Data Description
The input consists of:
1. One metro map image
2. A **Vertex Table**: each station contains a `Reliability` attribute representing the route reliability where larger values indicate higher reliability
3. An **Edge Table**: edges exist but their attributes are ignored for this task

# Pathfinding Requirements
1. The metro system must be treated as a weighted graph where each station receives its Reliability from the Vertex Table
2. These values must be used to compute the path with the highest average reliability
3. All Reliability values, originally ranging from 0–1, must be converted into one minus their values if needed for scoring, and any zero values must be excluded from averaging
4. All Reliability attributes of the destination station must be excluded from the evaluation, while all Reliability attributes of the starting station must be fully included

# Output Format Constraints
- **Separator**: Use hyphens `-` strictly, with no spaces around the hyphens
- **Transfer Marking**: If and only if a line transfer occurs at a station, append `(transfer)` immediately after its name
- **Content**: Output only the final route string. No markdown, no explanation, no filler

# Few-Shot Output Examples
Notice that this is only the output format example. In real question we will give you an image as map and the two tabulars (Edge Table and Vertex Table) for you to figure out the highest-reliability path.
