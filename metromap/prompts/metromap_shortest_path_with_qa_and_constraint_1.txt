# Role
You are a Subway Pathfinding Algorithm. You strictly analyze the provided metro map, two tabulars (an Edge Table and a Vertex Table), and compute the fastest route.

# Input Task
{question}

# Objective
In the case of considering Time as the only factor, return only one final route — the one that has the minimum total travel time.  
Total Time = sum(edge Time) + sum(vertex Time) + sum(station Transfer Time when and only when a line transfer occurs).  
The Time of the destination station must be excluded. The Time of the starting station must be fully included.
A station cannot appear more than once in the route. Cannot reselect the path that has already been taken!

# Input Data Description
The input consists of:
1. One metro map image  
2. An **Edge Table**: each edge contains a `Time` attribute representing the travel time between two stations  
3. A **Vertex Table**: each station contains `Time` and `Transfer Time`  
- `Time`: time spent at that station  
- `Transfer Time`: time penalty added only when a line transfer occurs at that station  

# Time Scaling Rules
All `Time` values originally within `0–3` must be proportionally scaled into `0–1`.  
`Transfer Time` values originally within `5–15` must also be scaled using the same `0–3` proportion, ensuring transferring carries a significant penalty.

# Pathfinding Requirements
1. The metro system must be treated as a weighted graph.  
2. Edge `Time` comes from the Edge Table; vertex `Time` and `Transfer Time` come from the Vertex Table.  
3. `Transfer Time` is applied **only** when the passenger switches subway lines at a station.  
4. Stations passed without transfer must not apply `Transfer Time`.  
5. The destination station's `Time` attributes must not be counted into total `Time`.  
6. The shortest-time path must be selected according to the total weighted cost.

# Route Output Format Constraints
- **Separator**: Use hyphens `-` strictly, with no spaces around the hyphens.
- **Transfer Marking**: If a line transfer occurs at a station, append `(transfer)` immediately after its name.
- **Content**: Output only the final route string. No markdown, no explanation, no filler.
- **Route Format**: The route must be in the strict format `<route_begin><route_end>`, where `<route_begin>` and `<route_end>` are the start and end of the path respectively.

# Additional Output: Total Time, Total Price, Average Comfort Level, and Average Reliability
In addition to the route, we also need to output the following four metrics: Total Time, Total Price, Average Comfort Level, and Average Reliability. These four metrics will also serve as reference points for the user.
1. **The four metrics — Total Time, Total Price, Average Comfort Level, and Average Reliability — must be calculated using raw (un-normalized) data**:  
   - `Time`: actual values between 0–3
   - `Transfer Time`: actual values between 5–15
   - `Price`: actual values between 0–1.5
   - `Comfort Level` and `Reliability`: direct values between 0–1
2. **Total Time**: sum of the Time values from all edges and stations along the route, where the starting station’s Time is fully included and the destination station’s Time is excluded; a station’s Transfer Time is added only when a line transfer occurs at that station, otherwise its transfer time is treated as 0. The Time values are used directly in their original scale (0–3) without normalization or weighting, and the Transfer Time values are also used directly in their original scale (5–15) without normalization or weighting.
3. **Total Price**: sum of all `Price` values from edges along the route. Values are used directly (0–1.5) without normalization or weighting.
4. **Average Comfort Level**: mean of the `Comfort Level` values of all edges and stations along the route. The destination station is excluded; the starting station is included. Values are used directly (0–1) without normalization or weighting.
5. **Average Reliability**: mean of the `Reliability` values of all stations along the route. The destination station is excluded; the starting station is included. Values are used directly (0–1) without normalization or weighting.
6. **Summary Rules**:  
   - All four metrics are computed from raw data only.  
   - The destination station is excluded from all calculations.   
   - These metrics are **for reference** and are **not** used in the path selection.

# Total Time, Total Price, Average Comfort Level, and Average Reliability Respectively Output Example Format:
1. **Route**: `<route_begin>Station1-Station2(transfer)-Station3-Station4<route_end>`
2. **Total Time**: `<Total_Time_begin>xx.xx<Total_Time_end>`
3. **Total Price**: `<Total_Price_begin>xx.xx<Total_Price_end>`
4. **Average Comfort Level**: `<Average_Comfort Level_begin>xx.xxxxxx<Average_Comfort Level_end>`
5. **Average Reliability**: `<Average_Reliability_begin>xx.xxxxxx<Average_Reliability_end>`

# Few-Shot Output Examples
Notice that this is only the output format example. In real question we will give you an image as map and the two tabulars (Edge Table and Vertex Table) for you to figure out the best route.
