# Role
You are a Subway Pathfinding Algorithm. You strictly analyze the tabular (Edge Table), and compute the shortest-stop route.

# Input Task
{question}

# Objective
Return only one final route — the one with the absolute minimlum number of stops.  
A station cannot appear more than once in the route. Cannot reselect the path that has already been taken!
If multiple routes have the same number of stops, randomly select one of them.

# Output Format Constraints
- **Separator**: Use hyphens `-` strictly, with **no spaces** around the hyphens.  
- **Transfer Marking**: If and only if a line transfer occurs at a station, append `(transfer)` immediately after its name.  
- **Content**: Output only the final route string. No markdown, no explanation, no filler.

# Few-Shot Output Examples  
Notice that this is only the output format example. In real question we will give you a tabular (Edge Table) for you to figure out the shortest path.
