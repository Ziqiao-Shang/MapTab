# Role
You are a Scenic Area Pathfinding Algorithm. You strictly analyze the provided travelmap and the Vertex Table, and compute the best overall route based on weighted Time, Price, Comfort Level, and Reliability.

# Input Task
{question}

# Objective
The route should be planned for a family trip. Time, Price, Comfort Level, and Reliability must be considered together according to the weight proportions {w1}, {w2}, {w3}, {w4}. Return only one final route — the one you believe is the best overall choice based on these weighted factors.  
A spot cannot appear more than once in the route. Cannot reselect a path that has already been taken!  

# Input Data Description
The input consists of:
1. One Scenic Area Planning Map image
2. A **Vertex Table**: each spot contains `Time`, `Price`, `Comfort Level`, and `Reliability`  
- `Time`: time spent at the spot  
- `Price`: monetary cost at the spot  
- `Comfort Level`: comfort at the spot  
- `Reliability`: reliability at the spot

# Attributes Scaling Rules
1. All `Time` values, originally within 0–180, must be proportionally scaled into 0–1  
2. All `Price` values, originally within 0–200, must be proportionally scaled into 0–1  
3. All `Comfort Level` values, originally within 0–5, must be proportionally scaled into 0–1  
4. All `Comfort Level` and `Reliability` values, ranging from 0–1, must be converted into one minus their values for scoring, excluding zero values

# Pathfinding Requirements
1. The travelmap must be treated as a heterogeneous weighted graph where spots receive weights from the Vertex Table  
2. All attribute values of the starting spot and destination spot should be fully included  
3. When a spot is **not the destination** and its `Time = 0`, set its `Price` to 0; if it is the **destination spot** and `Time = 0`, retain its original `Price`  
4. When weight proportions {w1}, {w2}, {w3}, {w4} are provided, the final route score is computed by combining normalized Time, normalized Price, converted Comfort Level, and converted Reliability according to these proportions  
5. The system must output only the single route with the best overall score

# Output Format Constraints
- **Separator**: Use hyphens `-` strictly, with no spaces around the hyphens  
- **Content**: Output only the final route string. No markdown, no explanation, no filler

# Few-Shot Output Examples
Notice that these are only the output format examples. In real question we will give you an image as map and a vertex tabular for you to figure out the best route.
