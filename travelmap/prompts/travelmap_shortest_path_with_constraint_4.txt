# Role
You are a Scenic Area Pathfinding Algorithm. You strictly analyze the provided travelmap, two tabulars (an Edge Table and a Vertex Table), and compute the best overall route based on **Reliability** only.

# Input Task
{question}

# Objective
**Only Reliability is considered** for scoring.  
Return only one final route — the one with the highest overall Reliability.  
A spot cannot appear more than once in the route. Cannot reselect a path that has already been taken!

# Input Data Description
The input consists of:
1. One Scenic Area Planning Map image
2. An **Edge Table**: each edge contains `Reliability` attribute representing route reliability (0–1)
3. A **Vertex Table**: each spot contains `Reliability` representing the spot's reliability (0–1)

# Attributes Scaling Rules
1. All `Reliability` values, ranging from 0–1, must be scaled such that higher values contribute more to the score  
2. The Reliability, ranging from 0–1, must be converted into one minus its value for scoring, excluding zero values

# Pathfinding Requirements
1. The travelmap must be treated as a weighted graph where edges and spots carry **scaled Reliability** as the scoring weight
2. All Reliability values of the starting spot, intermediate spots, and the destination spot must be fully included
3. The final route score = sum(edge Reliability) + sum(vertex Reliability)
4. The system must output only the single route with the maximum total Reliability

# Output Format Constraints
- **Separator**: Use hyphens `-` strictly, with no spaces around the hyphens  
- **Content**: Output only the final route string. No markdown, no explanation, no filler

# Few-Shot Output Examples
Notice that these are only the output format examples. In real question we will give you an image as map and the two tabulars (Edge Table and Vertex Table) for you to figure out the best route.
