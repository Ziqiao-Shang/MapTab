# Role
You are a Scenic Area Pathfinding Algorithm. You strictly analyze the provided travelmap, two tabulars (an Edge Table and a Vertex Table), and compute the best overall route based on weighted Price, Comfort Level, and Reliability.

# Input Task
{question}

# Objective
The route should be planned for an elderly traveler. Price, Comfort Level, and Reliability must be considered together according to the weight proportions {w2}, {w3}, {w4}. Return only one final route — the one you believe is the best overall choice based on these weighted factors.  
Time is considered indirectly for Price calculation but does not get an explicit weight in the final route scoring.  
A spot cannot appear more than once in the route. Cannot reselect a path that has already been taken!  

# Input Data Description
The input consists of:
1. One Scenic Area Planning Map image
2. An **Edge Table**: each edge contains `Time`, `Price`, `Comfort Level`, and `Reliability` attributes representing travel time (0–180), monetary cost (0–200), ride comfort (0–5), and route reliability (0–1)
3. A **Vertex Table**: each spot contains `Time`, `Price`, `Comfort Level`, and `Reliability`  
- `Time`: time spent at the spot (used for Price computation)  
- `Price`: monetary cost at the spot  
- `Comfort Level`: comfort at the spot  
- `Reliability`: reliability at the spot

# Attributes Scaling Rules
1. All `Time` values, originally within 0–180, must be proportionally scaled into 0–1 for Price adjustments  
2. All `Price` values, originally within 0–200, must be proportionally scaled into 0–1  
3. All `Comfort Level` values, originally within 0–5, must be proportionally scaled into 0–1  
4. All `Comfort Level` and `Reliability` values, ranging from 0–1, must be converted into one minus their values for scoring, excluding zero values

# Route Output Format Constraints
- **Separator**: Use hyphens `-` strictly, with no spaces around the hyphens.
- **Content**: Output only the final route string. No markdown, no explanation, no filler.
- **Route Format**: The route must be in the strict format `<route_begin><route_end>`, where `<route_begin>` and `<route_end>` are the start and end of the path respectively.

# Additional Output: Total Time, Total Price, Average Comfort Level, and Average Reliability
In addition to the route, we also need to output the following four metrics: Total Time, Total Price, Average Comfort Level, and Average Reliability. These four metrics will also serve as reference points for the user.
1. **The four metrics — Total Time, Total Price, Average Comfort Level, and Average Reliability — must be calculated using raw (un-normalized) data**:  
   - `Time`: actual values between 0–180. If the value exceeds this range, for example, 300, it will be counted as is, without enforcing the 0–180 limit.
   - `Price`: actual values between 0–200. If the value exceeds this range, for example, 300, it will be counted as is, without enforcing the 0–200 limit.
   - `Comfort Level`: actual values between 0–5.  
   - `Reliability`: direct values between 0–1
2. **Total Time**: sum of all Time values from edges and spots along the route. The Time of the starting point is fully included; the Time of the destination is excluded. Only raw values (0–180 or exceed) are used, without normalization or weighting. The total is the sum of the point values and edge values.
3. **Total Price**: sum of all Price values from edges and non-destination spots along the route, where the starting spot’s Price is fully included and the destination spot’s Price is excluded. Only raw values (0–180 or exceed) are used, without normalization or weighting. Only raw values (0–200 or exceed) are used, without normalization or weighting. Additionally, for any spot that is not the destination, if its Time = 0, its Price is forced to 0, while a destination spot with Time = 0 keeps its original Price. The total is the sum of the point values and edge values.
4. **Average Comfort Level**: mean of the Comfort Level values of all edges and spots along the route. The destination spot is excluded; the starting spot is included. Values are used directly (0–5) without normalization or weighting. The total is the sum of the point values and edge values. The number of items is the total number of spots (excluding the destination) plus the number of edges.
5. **Average Reliability**: mean of the Reliability values of all edges and spots along the route. The destination spot is excluded; the starting spot is included. Values are used directly (0–1) without normalization or weighting. The total is the sum of the point values and edge values. The number of items is the total number of spots (excluding the destination) plus the number of edges.
6. **Summary Rules**:  
   - All four metrics are computed from raw data only.  
   - The destination spot is excluded from all calculations.   
   - These metrics are **for reference** and are **not** used in the path selection.

# Total Time, Total Price, Average Comfort Level, and Average Reliability Respectively Output Example Format:
1. **Route**: `<route_begin>Spot1-Spot2-Spot3-Spot4<route_end>`
2. **Total Time**: `<Total_Time_begin>xx.x<Total_Time_end>`
3. **Total Price**: `<Total_Price_begin>xx.x<Total_Price_end>`
4. **Average Comfort Level**: `<Average_Comfort Level_begin>xx.xxxxxx<Average_Comfort Level_end>`
5. **Average Reliability**: `<Average_Reliability_begin>xx.xxxxxx<Average_Reliability_end>`

# Few-Shot Output Examples
Notice that this is only the output format example. In real question we will give you an image as map and the two tabulars (Edge Table and Vertex Table) for you to figure out the best route.
